# The Future of Work

### General: Books
* [Richard Susskind, Daniel Susskind. 'The Future of the Professions: How Technology Will Transform the Work of Human Experts.'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Professions-Technology-Transform-Experts/dp/0198713398)
* [Martin Ford. 'Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of Mass Unemployment.'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0147D1WIO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

### Specific examples
* [McFarland. 'What happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant': experiment by Ashok Goel, Georgia Tech. Bot was called 'Jill Watson'.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/05/11/this-professor-stunned-his-students-when-he-revealed-the-secret-identity-of-his-teaching-assistant/)

### Are people happy at work?
Relevance: 
* [Merelli, Quartz. 'Most people are actually pretty happy at work.' (May 30 2016)](http://qz.com/695071/most-people-are-actually-pretty-happy-at-work/)
	* Study: Endred-Ipsos 2016 Barometer, a yearly survey of well-being at work.
	* Of interest because I posited that there are a significant number of people that may be working unfulfilling jobs that will become redundant. But for the sake of social stability we may want to keep these people employed, so we may wish to create fulfilling but *seemingly* unnecessary jobs, thus creating a Pareto improvement if we pay them the net cost reduction from using technology. (I'm cheating because this is a poor comparative, but anyway. Get in touch if you want the more formal construction.)

### Other
* [Smith. 'Get Ready for High-Frequency Lawyers'](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-05-10/get-ready-for-high-frequency-lawyers) 
	* Of interest because it talks about economist Yuliy Sannikov's work on high-frequency contracts which I'd like to look at.

### Articles I haven't read yet
* [Brown-Philpot, CEO of TaskRabbit. 'People will still power an AI workforce.' (Nov 3 2016)](http://www.theverge.com/a/verge-2021/stacy-brown-philpot-taskrabbit-ceo-interview-ai-gig-economy)
