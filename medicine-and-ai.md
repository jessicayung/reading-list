# Medicine and AI (or data science)


### Articles
* ['Standing on the shoulders of gAInts: Artificial Intelligence may help unpick the complexity of biology', The Economist]()
    * **Drug discovery** with BenevolentAI (London): sifts through vast chemical libraries, medical databases and scientific papers looking for potential drug molecules.
        * Most of the obvious useful molecules have been found. Obscure molecules have long development periods and high failure rates.
        * Too much new information is being produced to be turned quickly into understanding. Scientific output doubles every nine years.
        * Richard Mead: Benevolent AI has given him two ideas for drugs for ALS (a neurodegenerative disease). 
    * IBM has partnered with Pfizer with the intention of accelerating drug discovery in immuno-oncology, a promising area of cancer therapy that encourages the body's own immune system to fight tumours.
    * Berg Health's AI system 
        * 1 analyses tissue samples, genomics and other clinical data relevant to a particular disease.
        * 2 tries to model from this info the network of protein interactions that underlie that disease. (Model is said to be incomplete.)
            * More work at the molecular level is needed before AI will be able to carck open the inner workings of a cell. E.g. project funded by the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative.
        * 3 Human researchers intervene to test the model's predictions in a real biological system.
        * Discovered a potential drug for topical squamous-cell carcinoma (a form of skin cancer) which has passed early trials for safety and efficacy and now awaits full-scale testing.
    * **Clinical care**: AI can reduce the time taken to delineate the edges of tumours in MRI and CT scans from up to four hours (by hand, current method) to minutes or even seconds. The results are completely consistent, unlike those arrived at by human doctors.
    * AI can be used to detect diabetic retinopathy and macular oedema, two causes of blindness, in pictures of the retina.
    * Enlitic (San Francisco) is making a system that will screen chest X-rays for signs of disease.
    * YourMD (London) is using AI, via an app, to offer diagnoses based on patients' queries about symptoms.
    * IBM (Watson) suggests treatment plans for a number of different cancers.

    * Current sequencing initatives (large-scale, government-led):
        * U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs’ Million Veteran Program; the 100,000 Genomes Project in the U.K.; and the NIH’s The Cancer Genome Atlas, which holds data from more than 11,000 patients and is open to researchers everywhere to analyze via the cloud. 
        * According to a recent study, as many as 2 billion human genomes could be sequenced by 2025.
    * Costs are lower: Sequencing one person's genome costs less than USD 1000 comarped to USD 10M ten years ago (in 2007).
    * Challenge: Current genomic data sets lack both volume and ethnic diversity.
        * Also have restrictive legal terms and reluctant sharing partnerships. (Understandable there are privacy concerns.)
    * Benefits:
        * Identify risk and screening
            * Discovering that you have a mutation linked to higher risk of certain types of cancer can sometimes be a life-saving bit of information. (from sequencing your genome)
        * Accelerate cancer drug development and therapy selections, enabling doctors to match patients with clinical trials, and improving their abilities to provide custom treatment plans for cancer patients (Herceptin, one of the earliest examples, remains one of the best).
    * To-dos:
        * Patients should be able to contribute data easily. This includes medical records, radiology images and genetic testing. Laboratory companies and medical centers should adopt a common consent form to make it easy and legal for data sharing to occur. 
        * More funding is needed for researchers working at the intersection of AI, data science and cancer. 
        * New data sets should be generated, focused on people of all ethnicities. We need to make sure that advances in cancer research are accessible to all.

    * First successful 'limb reanimation' in a person with quadriplegia. (Ian Burkhart, 24.) Using nerve bypass technology that transmits his thoughts directly to his hand muscles, he has temporarily regained control over his right hand and fingers.
        * Signals in the brain detected by a computer chip implant
        * Signals decoded by computer
        * Computer stimulates correct muscles in armm via electronic sleeve, allowing movement to be controlled by thought

### Thoughts:
* How might this aid the discovery of new antibiotics?
* How might this help reduce the price of drugs?
* How might this help alleviate pressure on the NHS and health services worldwide and through that increase access to medical care?
