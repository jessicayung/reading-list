### Syrian Refugees in Turkey
[Huffington Post Article](http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/the-21st-century-gold-rush-refugees/#/turkey)

#### Syrian child labour in Turkey
* Child labour is especially common in the border areas, where most refugees live. Children were present in every factory the Huffington Post visited. 
* Work conditions:
    * Work 12-hour shifts daily
    * Regularly work with toxic chemicals
    * Usually wear no protective gear
    * Are often unable to read safety warnings because they cannot speak Turkish.
    * At least 19 Syrian children have died in the workplace since 2013. (Istanbul Council for Workers’ Health and Safety)
* e.g. Mohammed started working 12-hour days when he was 10. He’s missed three or four grades. He’s paid 800 lira (USD 227) a month.
* In a sandal-making factory in Gaziantep:
    * Child that looked to be around 5 years old.
    * None of the children wore protective gear.
    * Dozens of kids were clustered around a giant mechanised wheel, pasting soles onto leather sandals.
    * The air was thick with clouds of plastic shavings and the stench of glue.
* Syrian children have been discovered making 
    * apparel for international brands such as Marks and Spencer, ASOS and H&M,
    * military uniforms for ISIS
    * Fake lifejackets filled with non-buoyant packing materials, which are marketed to migrants crossing the Mediterranean.

* Government policy
    * Done little to address issue.
    * Syrian children are entitled to attend Turkish public schools for free. 
        * But most don’t, either because they can’t speak Turkish, or because their families can’t afford to lose their incomes. 
            * The Turkish education minister said in early 2016 that at least 400,000 refugee children were not enrolled in formal schooling. This means that there are now thousands of children who have missed out on four or five years of education.
            * 'Lost generation of Syrian children'

* Children without education (and so without prospects to earn more?) risk being turned into terrorists: e.g. in Kilis (border town in Turkey) which is a popular location for ISIS recruiters.

#### Effect on Turkish employment
* There are 500k Syrians in Gaziantep (Turkey).
* Displacing Turks, especially Turkish women, in the informal sector (displaces 6 Turks for every 10 refugees who have found work) and for low-skilled jobs. 
* Cause Turkish women to work for about 60% of the minimum wage when they do find work.

#### Hostility against Syrian refugees in Turkey
* 2014 protests against Syrian Workers in Gaziantep, Turkey.
    * Groups of Turks wielding sticks and knives roamed the streets, attacking Syrians. 
    * Hundreds of Turkish workers in Izmir yelled slogans like, “The boss likes low-cost labor; we don't want Syrian workers.” 
* Dec 2016 survey (Istanbul): More than 90 percent of people said that refugees had driven up rents and made it harder for them to find employment. **Fourteen percent of respondents found refugees “disgusting.”**

* Impact: Makes it harder for the government to address the root causes of the problem. 
    * Policy: President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan floated a tentative proposal to offer citizenship to Syrians with specific skill sets, in order to better integrate them into the population
        * Response: the announcement was met with a torrent of protest and went nowhere. 
    * Positive policy: In January 2016, the government enacted regulations that would create a pathway for refugees to work legally. 
        * However, they contain a number of stringent provisions that will likely prevent most refugees from taking advantage of them.

### Doing business in Syria

Fraught with risks:
* The country has fractured into four mini-economies that are controlled, respectively, by the Assad regime, ISIS, opposition groups and the Kurds. 
    * Opposing groups regularly trade in essential supplies.
        * E.g. Free Syrian Army in Hama regularly buys sugar, rice, benzene, cement and fertilizer from the Assad regime.
* In the absence of functioning banks, most transactions in Syria are done in cash. Kattan had delivered two truckloads of powdered milk to a buyer. The man loaded it into his truck, and then informed him that he didn’t have money to pay for it, but would come back tomorrow. “‘This is powdered milk, it is for the children, it’s very important,’” Kattan recalled the buyer saying. He added, “I am emotional, so I said, ‘I trust you.’” But he never saw the man again—to this day, he doesn’t know if he died or stole his money. The milk was worth $56,000. To pay his supplier, Kattan drained his savings and took out an $8,000 loan from a friend. “I had to start from zero again,” he said.
* regularly trade in essential supplies
* Operations:
    * In recent months, much of the cross-border action has moved from Kilis to Reyhanli, where drivers told us about 300 trucks were entering Syria each day, mostly carrying concrete and steel to repair ravaged buildings. 
    * Syrian trucks are not allowed to officially enter Turkey, and vice versa. Instead, drivers meet in a “neutral zone” a few miles from the Turkish border gate, where goods are transferred from Turkish trucks to Syrian ones. Whoever controls the border gate on the Syrian side collects a sizable tariff. 
    * In Syria, the drivers then take the goods to a market where they are bought by wholesalers for distribution. The further from the border the trucks go, the more expensive the goods become. 
        * According to an activist named Fadi Almaari, who is based in what was then Al Nusra territory, when regime traders have a monopoly on certain staples, they often withhold them from the market entirely. “Then when the price is high, they allow the rice to go in,” he said.
* **High revenues**: 
    * Smuggling, kidnapping, and imposing taxes on the flow of goods and people between territories is now a vastly more reliable source of income than what little remains of the traditional economy. 
    * In fact, these practices have become so lucrative that it is “creating incentives for those now making money from the conflict to prolong it,” according to a study by Jihad Yazigi for the European Council on Foreign Relations. 
    * Some opposition forces, Yazigi noted, are now more preoccupied with their business dealings than their military activities against the Assad regime. He described an episode in which an opposition brigade prolonged its siege of a regime military base in order to bring in more foreign donations. In addition, the rebels had actually delivered food to the regime forces they were fighting in exchange for bribes.
    * A single iron transporter can earn millions of USD in revenue per year.


### Refugees in Germany
* Over 1 million refugees absorbed into Germany since August 2015.
* Refugee centres often run by LaGeSo (Berlin's State Office of Health and Social Affairs)
* Stage 1: get people out of the cold.
    * Refugees crammed into gyms, empty office buildings, army barracks, 'winterised' tents.
    * **Refugee accommodation business**: LaGeSo started handing migrants 50 euro vouchers they could use for one night's stay as a stopgap.
        * Overnight, Hostels hiked rates from 30 to 50 euros per night. 
            * People sublet their apartments or offered accommodation in garages and toolsheds to take advantage of this gold rush. Profit hundreds of euros per month per apartment.
        * Est. government overspent on housing by more than 100M euros.
    * **Running makeshift emergency shelters**: LaGeSo started cold-calling companies and businesspeople because there weren't enough experienced organisations (e.g. Red Cross, private firms that ran public housing projects and homeless shelters) to go around.
        * Offered 25 euros per refugee, i.e. > 9000 euros (per filled spot) over the course of a year.
    * Opened the seven-hangar airport Tempelhof to refugees. Hosted up to 2,500 people. 
        * Camp set up in fewer than 24 hours. Initially had no showers - refugees bussed to nearby swimming pools to wash in changing rooms. Most only managed to shower twice a week. Port-a-potties instead of toilets.
            * Now have toilets, but it smells - sometimes they don't clean it for two to three days.
        * Many refugees lived here for months. Described as being like a prison. Each partitioned room is 5 by 5 meters and has 12 beds. There's metal everywhere.
    * **Refugee housing**: 
        * Examples of high demand for refugee housing
            * High demand for “container villages”—stackable housing units constructed from shipping containers that can be assembled within six weeks. 
                * Container-Handelsbüro, won the largest container village contract in its history—23 million euros—to build 1,700 units. 
                * Another firm called Paranet tripled its annual profits in 2015 by selling giant inflatable domes to house refugees. 
                * A company in southern Germany received so many requests for refugee "starter kits" containing basic furniture and utensils that orders were backed up for five weeks, even though they brought on more employees.
            * European Homecare (corporate) is now Germany's largest refugee housing provider. (Formerly a niche company that has offered services for asylum seekers since the early 1990s.) 
                * Operating 100 facilities capable of hosting 20,000 people. 
                * Revenues and profits: 
                    * Its revenues spiked from 17 million euros in 2013 to more than 100 million euros in 2015 (FT). 
                    * Handelsblatt a German business journal, found that the company’s return on equity is an astonishing 66 percent, which it has achieved by keeping costs as low as possible. 
                * European Homecare reportedly spends as little as 11 euros per refugee per day. 
        * Poor quality: A lot of these camps don’t care about halal food; they don’t give refugees shampoo. 
        * Staffing: high demand for Arabic-speaking guards for shelters has sometimes resulted in the hiring of guards who haven’t been properly trained or screened
            * Sharp increase firms operating in the “grey zone”: subcontractors employed by larger security companies to cover shortfalls.
            * European Homecare facility noted, “We cannot pay the security personnel too much, or else we will no longer qualify for government housing benefits.
            * Examples of hired private security guards being horrible:
                *  In 2014, prosecutors released pictures of a grinning guard at a European Homecare facility in North Rhine-Westphalia, posing with his boot on the head of a refugee. 
                * In a video filmed at the same camp, another guard forced a man to lie on a mattress covered in vomit.
                * A police investigation later revealed that at least two of the guards involved had a criminal record.
                * Outside the LaGeSo facility in Berlin, guards were filmed calling for migrants to be sent to concentration camps and promising them that “work will make you free,” the words infamously posted above the gates of Auschwitz.
    * **Accepting refugees to tackle Germany's catastrophic demographic decline**:
        * Reason: Germany is one of the oldest countries in the world. By 2050, the number of people under the age of 15 is poised to fall to 13 percent. Given the high costs of Germany’s welfare state, it is facing a labor shortage of existential proportions. Here, all of a sudden, were hundreds of thousands of people, more than half of them under the age of 25, clamoring to build new lives in Germany. The CEO of Daimler described migrants as an “economic miracle.”
        * Difficulties:
            * Less than 15 percent of Syrian refugees in Germany have a college degree or any form of vocational training, according to a government survey. Even when migrants do have qualifications, they often don’t meet the standards of Germany’s rigorous three-year apprenticeship system.
            * 98 percent of asylum-seekers don’t speak German
                * The government has doubled its budget for language instruction to 559 million euros, which will pay for 300,000 refugees to take a 660-hour course in basic German. 
                * More than basic German needed for technical fluency though.
    * **Attitude towards refugees in Germany**
        * In 2015, there were more than 690 arson and other attacks on refugee camps.
        * Over the past eighteen months, Merkel’s popularity fell to a five-year low this fall following a series of terror attacks in Europe. 
        * Merkel faces an insurgent far-right party, the Alternative for Germany, whose leader, Frauke Petry, wants the German police to be empowered to shoot migrants entering the country illegally. 
            * The AfD’s popularity surged in the wake of hundreds of sexual assaults on German women that occurred on New Year’s Eve in Cologne—an incident that was largely blamed on refugees. It is now the third-most popular party in Germany and has secured seats in five state parliaments.
